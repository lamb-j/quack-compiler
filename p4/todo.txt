// figure out what is inheretied from parent->child, and how to pass stuff on
// special case when in statements of class, dealing with "this"

	void add_parent_methods (method_list my_methods, method_list parent_methods) {
	  if theres a clash, 
		  keep my_method, but make sure stuff is as below
      - check that if method overrides, return type is subtype and args are supertype (and num args match)

	// should wait until second pass
	void add_parent_fields (field_map my_fields, field_map parent_fields) {
	  if clash types have to match,
		and if my_fields doesn't have all of parent_fields, error


Later
	- check for uninitalized vars with ifs/whiles




// deal with field stuff

  just fill out field table
	if not "this", error
