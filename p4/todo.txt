static_check.cpp
   - undefined method

type_checks.cpp
   - times/sub/multipe mismatch, class defined
   - if/elif condition ( lca(thing, boolean) == boolean required)

   - scoping, so each class, method has its own var_table, separate from statement's var_table


   - actual arg type subtype of formal arg
   - actual arg list wrong length
   - method not found in class or superclass
   - check return type in method against defined type

   - check that if method overrides, return type is subtype and args are supertype (and num args match)


Later
   - check for uninitalized vars with ifs/whiles
