Class Hierachy
   - Tree rooted at Obj
   - Built in classes are:
      - Obj, Int, String, Nothing
	 1. Superclass must be defined.
	 2. No loops
	 3. Tree should be Dag (single inheritence)

	 Check and report errors if not well formed

	 Solution:
	   1. Create list of classes
		 2. Check each superclass against list

		 3. DFS to check for DAG (or loops)

Constructor Call References
   - Report any constructor calls to classes that don't exist.
	 - These could occur in the statements, or in another class definition.


	 Solution: 
	   A. In class definitions:
		   1. save a list of all constructor calls
			 2. check list against list of classes

		 B. In statements defintions:
		   1. check any constructor against list of classes

Lexer
  - Add error checking
	- Add unary minus
