  when we make a new tree node, add to list, and to root
	append(new, parent)

    IF
      search list for new
		    if found 
				  found.parent = new.parent
					found.parent->children.push_back(new)

    ELSE
	    search list for parent 
		    if exists
				  new = new tree_node
					list.add new
			    parent->children.push_back (new)
				  child->parent = parent;

			  else
				  new = new tree_node
					parent = new tree_node
					list.add new
					list.add parent
			    parent->children.push_back (new)
				  child->parent = parent;
			  

	make flag vector 
	Walk tree from Obj, set flags
